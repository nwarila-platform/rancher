# ansible/inventory/

## There is no static inventory, and that is deliberate

The AWS deploy is **ephemeral**: every run creates new instances, converges them, and destroys them.
An instance id written into a file here would be wrong the moment the run that produced it ended.

## `aws_ec2.yml` — one run's instances, describing themselves

The file is in two parts. The first is the only part that is about this repository: the region, the
four tag filters that select one run's instances — `RepositoryId`, `RunId` and `Repository` from the
workflow's own environment, and `Environment` from `ENVIRONMENT` or `test` — and the `rancher_servers`
(`Function = rancher-server`) and `rancher_agents` (`Function = rancher-agent`) groups the plays
address. Everything below that is carried from the fleet's reference repository,
with the differences listed below.

Hosts are named by their **Name tag**, which is the hostname Terraform declares, so
`inventory_hostname` is the system's own name and nothing downstream has to be told it again. Every
attribute the plugin publishes is namespaced with `aws_`, which keeps the EC2 instance `state` from
colliding with the role input that selects `present_redhat.yml` or `absent_redhat.yml`.

## Everything else is derived from the instance

| Value | Derived from |
|---|---|
| Operating system, login account, shell type | `platform_details`, which every instance carries and which names the platform it is licensed as |
| Connection, port, address, SSM proxy | the `Connection` tag |
| `ENV` (the framework loader's input) | the `Environment` tag |

The private key is not the inventory's: the play's ordered credential sets name it, and
`credential_resolver` publishes the set that works as the host's identity. An
`ansible_ssh_private_key_file` set here would outrank that published identity, so the inventory sets
none.

The `Connection` tag takes four values, and absent means `ssh-direct`:

| Value | Reaches the host by |
|---|---|
| `ssh-direct` | SSH to the routable address on 22 |
| `ssh-ssm` | SSH to the instance id, tunnelled by an SSM `ProxyCommand`; needs no inbound rule |
| `winrm-direct` | WinRM over HTTPS to the routable address on 5986 |
| `winrm-ssm` | WinRM over HTTPS to a local port an SSM port-forwarding session already holds open |

A WinRM leg also needs a password, because WinRM has no key authentication; the SSH legs
authenticate with the key pair.

## Where this differs from the reference inventory, and why

| Setting | Reference | Here | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ansible_python_interpreter` on RHEL | `/usr/libexec/platform-python` | `/usr/bin/python3` | These hosts are RHEL 9: its python3 is 3.9, ansible-core 2.21's floor, RPM-owned and so trusted by fapolicyd, and present before the bootstrap. The framework's `redhat_rocky_9` bootstrap runs modules from its first task and installs 3.12 only for its venv, so naming 3.12 fails a fresh host (measured 2026-10-09). |
| `ansible_pipelining` | unset | `true` | fapolicyd on a STIG host denies an interpreter opening an untrusted script, which is what a module staged as a file is. Pipelining streams it over stdin instead. |
| Tag reads | `aws_ec2_tags.X` | `(aws_ec2_tags \| default(aws_tags)).X` | Reads either variable, so a controller on either side of amazon.aws 11.2's rename resolves the groups (PR #12). |
| Host keys | `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` | `StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new` | Carried from this repository's skeleton. Every CI run starts with an empty known_hosts, so both accept each new host; accept-new still refuses a key that changes within a run. |
| `ansible_user` | left to `credential_resolver` | composed from the platform | Carried from the skeleton. The resolver's contract permits it, and the published credential set outranks it. |
| `windows_password_source` | absent | composed, empty on SSH legs | Carried from the skeleton for a WinRM leg this repository does not use; nothing reads it on an SSH leg. |

The first two are ignored by Windows connections, so they can move back into the reference
inventory unchanged.

## Running the playbook by hand

Export `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID`, `GITHUB_RUN_ID` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` plus AWS credentials, then
point `-i` at `aws_ec2.yml` while the instances still exist. Set `ENVIRONMENT` if the deployment is
not the default `test`. The play asserts its ownership contract, so a run whose tags do not match
fails closed.

The play also needs the stack's endpoint as an extra-var: `rancher_load_balancer_dns`, the
network load balancer's DNS name, from `terraform output -json aws_load_balancer_dns_names`.
