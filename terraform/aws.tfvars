# File: 'terraform/aws.tfvars'
# --- [ Description ] ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Variable input for the pinned aws-terraform-framework (SHA in .github/terraform-framework-pin).
# Plain tfvars — the workflow passes this file to terraform verbatim. This repository declares
# NO .tf files of its own: resources live in the pinned framework, configuration in the pinned
# ansible-framework plus this repository's roles.
#
# REACHABILITY — DIRECT SSH OVER A PUBLIC IPv4. The workflow discovers the runner's public IPv4
# and passes it as the framework's runtime-only runner_ip variable. When an operator hostname is
# configured it resolves that too and passes debug_ip, which adds RDP for a person working on the
# host. The framework attaches one security group carrying both to every interface. The instance
# receives a public IPv4 at launch; no Elastic IP is involved. The account has no NAT and no VPC
# endpoints.
#
# The dependency worth knowing: MapPublicIpOnLaunch is an attribute of a shared subnet no
# repository owns. Direct SSH requires the instance's launch-time public address as well as the
# runner-scoped security group.
#
# readiness_gate is FALSE by design: the playbook owns the bounded direct-SSH readiness check.
# The host is Linux; SSH lands on the AMI's ec2-user and the composed play's bootstrap takes it
# from there.
#
# =========================================================================================== #

# environment and the deployment identity (repository, repository_id, commit_sha, run_id) are
# deliberately NOT in this file: the workflow passes them as -var flags placed AFTER this file on
# the command line. Terraform resolves repeated command-line assignments in the order given, so it
# is that ordering, not the kind of flag, that keeps this file from renaming the deployment.
